# What is it

---
Cryptohagen is a series of informal get-togethers every last Sunday
of the month in Copenhagen.

There is a similar event in [Aarhus][cryptoaarhus]

## Who is it for

The meetup is for everyone who uses the Internet in one form or
another.

- You might be a student needing to research topics like Al-Quaeda,
  ISIS and suicide bombing techniques
- Perhaps you live in a problematic relationship and need a way to
  get help without your partner being alerted
- Are you an investigative journalist and need some tools to help
  protect an important source?
- Or maybe you're really the next Edward Snowden

We are a bunch of nerds who gather to help you get started using some
of the popular and widely accepted security tools. Both on your
computer and on your smartphone.

So come on down and say hi, have a chat and a nice cup of coffee.

All you need to bring is your good mood. If you would like technical
help, you are more than welcome to bring your laptop or mobile device!
